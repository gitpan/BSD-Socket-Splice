=head1 NAME

BSD::Socket::Splice - Perl interface to OpenBSD socket splicing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use BSD::Socket::Splice;

  $so = new IO::Socket;
  $sosp = new IO::Socket;
  setsplice($so, $sosp);
  setsplice($so, $sosp, $max);
  setsplice($so, $sosp, $max, $idle);
  setsplice($so);

  $len = getsplice($so);
  $errno = geterror($so);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The BSD::Socket::Splice module implements a Perl interface to OpenBSD
socket splicing.
This allows zero-copy data transfer between TCP sockets.
Compared to invoking the system calls manually with pack() and
setsockopt(), the module provides a convenient and machine independent
way to access the kernel.

Nothing is exported by default, the following functions can be
exported on demand:

=over 4

=item B<setsplice($so, $sosp)>,
B<setsplice($so, $sosp, $max)>,
B<setsplice($so, $sosp, $max, $idle)>,
B<setsplice($so)>

Splice together the source socket $so and the drain socket $sosp.
Then the kernel will move network data from $so to $sosp without
further user-land interaction.
For bidirectional splicing two function-calls with exchanged socket
parameters are necessary.

The second form allows to specify a maximum number bytes to transfer.
Note that a short splice might happen which means that fewer data
has been moved.
If that has happened, a second call pointing to the same maximum
will succeed and move the outstanding data.

The third form allows to specify an idle timeout for the connection.

Splicing of two sockets will get dissolved automatically in case
of end-of-file at the source socket, if a read or write error occurred
or if the optional maximum has been reached.
An existing splicing can be dissolved manually by using the fourth
form.

=item B<getsplice($so)>

Return the number of bytes already transfered from this socket by
splicing.

=item B<geterror($so)>

Return the error number attached to this socket.
This is not specific to splicing but is added here for convenience.
All errors during data transfer can be retrieved from the source
socket.

=item B<SO_SPLICE>

Return the kernel constant for the socket splicing socket option.
It is not necessary to use this constant as the kernel interface
is encapsulated by this module.

=head1 ERRORS

When called with bad argument types the functions carp.
In general setsplice(), getsplice(), geterror() set $! and
return I<undef> in case of an error.
setsplice() and getsplice() try to convert between the I<off_t>
value of the operating system and Perl's integer and numeric value
automatically.
If they fail to do so, they set $! to EINVAL and return I<undef>.
